<think>I need to create a comprehensive README.md file for the Tripeasy application. Based on what I've seen so far, this appears to be a travel planning application with both mobile and web interfaces that allows users to:

1. Create trips
2. Search for destinations
3. Select travel dates
4. Choose traveler types
5. Set budgets
6. Generate AI-powered trip plans with flights, hotels, and itineraries
7. View trip details
8. Share trips

I should include:
- Project title and description
- Features overview
- Technologies used
- Installation instructions
- Usage examples
- Screenshots if possible (though I don't have access to them)
- Credits (mentioning Mohsin Chunawala as the developer)
- License information

I'll structure a comprehensive README based on what I've seen in the codebase.</think># Tripeasy - AI-Powered Travel Planning
